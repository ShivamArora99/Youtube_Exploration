The three friends from Opération Zéro, Malick, Jay and Kali (among others producer of Maître Gims, Stress) have been working on sweaty live shows and the unique sound of eternal vacations in Swiss german and French since their youth. With the EP ""Uszyt"" they combined the vibes and message of a hot summer, with ""Immer"" and ""Rosé"" they conquered the radios for the first time. The new EP ""Wo mir de härägö"" heralds this summer with big sentiments, afrobeats and urban pop.

Lyrics:

Si läbe au die stories

Ja die frou di het looks

U sy fyyrä di scho meh aus mi

Du bisch dqueen dervo, ds gfüu im buch isch lo lo lo

I kenne di sit kurzem
Doch du hesch überno
Du bisch capitaine
De mon vesseau

I bi nur churz i kiosk, aber der Samir fragt iz no
Du die, vo denn, wieso hesch du si nid nomau mitgno,
Er redt vo attitude, i schetze dini gratitude
Du nimmsch mini finke bim erste mau, direkt habitude
De gruch vom café wo du machsch macht immer aues wieder guet

Born in Yorkshire, Dominic Harrison began writing his own songs at 10 years old, enticed by the thrill of catharsis and self-expression he couldn’t find anywhere else. Since his self-titled debut EP in 2018, the 25-year-old’s lyrics have found universality in introspection, reckoning with sexuality, gender, class, gentrification and mental illness with disarming honesty in order to encapsulate the spirit of his generation. His fans are legion, and the numbers are reflective of this resonance: Harrison has 7.2 million Spotify Monthly Listeners, 5 million followers on TikTok and total YouTube views in nine figures.

BNXN (fka Buju) is a 26-year-old Afro-fusion singer/songwriter from Lagos, Nigeria. In December 2021 he headlined his first sold out concert after which he released several chart-placing songs such as chart-topping “Finesse” with Pheelz, “Propeller” with Jae5 and British rapper Dave and “Mood” with Wizkid to name a few. In 2022, BNXN won two Headie awards, one for Next Rated artist and one for Best Rap Single for his collaboration “Feeling” with Ladipoe.

LYRICS:
Bilmem insan
Bunu nasıl edebilir ifade
(I don’t know, how can someone express this)
Aklım her an
Bile bile girebilir her hale
(My mind just can enter any kind of mood)
Biz ikimizi saklasak
(What if we hide two of us)
Biraz beklesek
(and we wait for a while)
Ya da uzatmasak
(Or let’s not put the love off)
Bunu diretmesek
(not insist on it - being seperate-)
Ve kalp akla taktı bi kelepçe hep
(And heart has always put a handcuff to the mind)

If you wanna be friends I like that
If you don’t wanna pretend, I like that more
We could be on the run, forever
You’ll be my only one, forever more
My one love, my one love
Swear that I would put no one above ya
If you wanna begin, I like that
My one love, my one love

Sun le
(Listen)
Abhi tau shuru hoye ye rastay
(Our paths have just begun)
Hongai in kahaniyon ke charchay
(This story will be talked about everywhere)
O sun le, o sun le
(Just listen, Just listen)
Sun le, saari baatein karle tu khul k
(Listen, just say it out loud)
Kabhi dil ki khabar bhi tou le
(Just once look into your heart)
Kya kahe, yeh kya kahe
(What does it say, what does it say?)
Silsilay phir kyun na milay
(Why wouldn’t our streamlet meet)
Jab dil ki sabhi
(When everything that’s in our heart)
Sar-e-aam bhi dikhay
(Is out in the open)

If you wanna be friends I like that
If you don’t wanna pretend, I like that more
We could be on the run, forever
You’ll be my only one, forever more
My one love, my one love
Swear that I would put no one above ya
If you wanna begin, I like that
My one love, my one love

LYRICS:
Ever since I was young (Coming up, coming up) 
Always marching to a drum (Bra-da-dum, Bra-da-dum) 
Always focused on me (One one, one one) 
Now I wish that I could hold someone (Someone) 
 
So tell my mom, I love her 
Call my baby sister 
Should've hugged and kissed her 
'Cause life is just a mystery 
And it's gone before you know it 
So if you love me, won't you show it? 
  
'Cause this life is one big symphony 
This night is one for you and me 
I'm the strings and you're the timpani 
You're my constant tambourine 
This life is one big symphony 
So glad I've got you next to mе 
I'm the chords and you're the mеlody 
This life's one big symphony 
  
She was the piano 
I'm the xylophone 
You can have the trumpet 
I'm the saxophone 
 
Life is skipping rope (Keep going, keep going) 
Finding solace in a note (Dote dote, dote dote) 
Had to struggle when I was broke (So low, so low) 
Writing music just to cope (No hope, no hope) 
  
Yeah, life is just perspective 
Laughing when you've wrecked it 
Smiling when you kept it together 
You weathered the storm 
At the end of the play, you sang all the way 
Doesn't matter how off-key if you did it your way 
  
This life is one big symphony 
This night is one for you and me 
I'm the strings and you're the timpani 
You're my constant tambourine 
This life is one big symphony 
So glad I've got you next to me 
I'm the chords and you're the melody 
This life's one big symphony 
 
Would you care if I played you the flute? 
See, it's my favorite one because it's so delicate and beautiful 
I pull out the trombone if it's more suitable 
Wanna make you smile 
It's been a little while since I've seen the white of your teeth 
Been a hard year 
Lucky the guitar's here 

 Life is just one big symphony 
This life is one big symphony 
This night is one for you and me 
I'm the strings and you're the timpani 
You're my constant tambourine 
This life is one big symphony 
So glad I've got you next to me 
I'm the chords and you're the melody 
This life's one big symphony

NewJeans are the first group to launch from ADOR, HYBE’s independent label led by Min Hee-Jin. Through their truthful and authentic music that evidence youthful spirits, the five-member act (MINJI HANNI, DANIELLE, HAERIN and HYEIN) aspires to elevate K-pop to new heights by pushing the boundaries of the existing K-pop scene.

Born and raised in East Atlanta, Grammy nominated J.I.D grew up on his parents’ collection of classic funk/soul LPs, and broke onto the scene with his 2015 EP, DiCaprio. The EP saw him collaborating with hip-hop duo EARTHGANG, whom he’d previously joined on a 2014 tour. Spotted here by J.Cole, J.I.D was promptly signed to Dreamville/Interscope Records. J.I.D’s nimble, head-nodding lyricism and lightning fast flow has awarded him a loyal and cult-like fanbase and his dedication to perfecting the art is sportsman-like, leaving room for him to be one of rap’s greatest in the making.

Lonely one
Out there on and eagles' wings
You’re bringing something they can’t bring
And singing something they can’t sing
I know it’s lonely when you’re saying something they ain’t heard

But just follow me and we will learn
It's tough but you can only be who you are
That’s just who I am that’s just my radio
That’s just who I am that’s just my video

Before the thunder, rain, storm, the pavement 
I grew some wings that we can fly away with 
Do the things that you cannot explain and 
Find a way to get us out a maze 
What we made of, on the cusp of doing something greater, unafraid 
Been over all the underestimation, don’t get mad at your imagination 
If it’s real magic, you ain’t gotta chase it 
You can only be who you are 

That’s just who I am that’s just my radio 
That’s just who I am that’s just my video (Real Magic) 
That’s just who I, I, I am I, I, I can’t pretend ‘cause I know 
You can only be who you are 
That’s just who I am that’s just my radio 
That’s just who I am that’s just my video 
Wherever you are, oh lord 
You can only be who you are 

언제나 걸고있는 주문이 들리지 
(Can hear the magic always) 
Clear all the talk away, there’s nothing better really 
우리 이대로 다 
(Us, just as we are) 
Go ahead and try 
완성됐어 이미 (yeah) 
(Complete already yeah) 
Got into the spirit (yeah) 
잘했어 we did it yeah yeah 
(Good job, we did it yeah yeah) 

Que venga todo el mundo a ver 
(Let all the world come and see) 
que cuando estoy contigo es mi cosa preferida, 
(that when I'm with you is my favorite thing) 
que la vida es más grande mientras más es compartida 
(that life is bigger the more it is shared) 
que cuando estamos juntos mi vida 
(that when we are together my life) 
la magia no termina 
(the magic doesn't end) 
We can only be who we are 

That’s just who I am that’s just my radio 
That’s just who I am that’s just my video 
That’s just who I, I, I am I, I, I can’t pretend ‘cause I know 
You can only be who you are
