The three friends from Op√©ration Z√©ro, Malick, Jay and Kali (among others producer of Ma√Ætre Gims, Stress) have been working on sweaty live shows and the unique sound of eternal vacations in Swiss german and French since their youth. With the EP ""Uszyt"" they combined the vibes and message of a hot summer, with ""Immer"" and ""Ros√©"" they conquered the radios for the first time. The new EP ""Wo mir de h√§r√§g√∂"" heralds this summer with big sentiments, afrobeats and urban pop.

Lyrics:
Dis l√§chle 50 shades
W√∂u aui sy gfesslet
Ha lang uf d vernunft glost doch
Mis herz weisses besser
Si l√§be au die stories
Wo du ihne verzeusch
Ja die frou di het looks
U die frou die het seu
Isch es doof doof doof cha ja sy
I nenne di scho hajati
Mini bros bros bros sy derbi
U sy fyyr√§ di scho meh aus mi

Du bisch ds erst mau im quartier, und scho ize navigiersch,
Du bisch dqueen dervo, ds gf√ºu im buch isch lo lo lo

I kenne di sit kurzem
Doch du hesch √ºberno
Du bisch capitaine
De mon vesseau

I bi nur churz i kiosk, aber der Samir fragt iz no
Du die, vo denn, wieso hesch du si nid nomau mitgno,
Er redt vo attitude, i schetze dini gratitude
Du nimmsch mini finke bim erste mau, direkt habitude
De gruch vom caf√© wo du machsch macht immer aues wieder guet
Mit der fam am charboner du bisch der windstoss i mire gluet",2023-09-05T09:08:12Z,1131,24,0,PT3M22S

Born in Yorkshire, Dominic Harrison began writing his own songs at 10 years old, enticed by the thrill of catharsis and self-expression he couldn‚Äôt find anywhere else. Since his self-titled debut EP in 2018, the 25-year-old‚Äôs lyrics have found universality in introspection, reckoning with sexuality, gender, class, gentrification and mental illness with disarming honesty in order to encapsulate the spirit of his generation. His fans are legion, and the numbers are reflective of this resonance: Harrison has 7.2 million Spotify Monthly Listeners, 5 million followers on TikTok and total YouTube views in nine figures.

BNXN (fka Buju) is a 26-year-old Afro-fusion singer/songwriter from Lagos, Nigeria. In December 2021 he headlined his first sold out concert after which he released several chart-placing songs such as chart-topping ‚ÄúFinesse‚Äù with Pheelz, ‚ÄúPropeller‚Äù with Jae5 and British rapper Dave and ‚ÄúMood‚Äù with Wizkid to name a few. In 2022, BNXN won two Headie awards, one for Next Rated artist and one for Best Rap Single for his collaboration ‚ÄúFeeling‚Äù with Ladipoe. BNXN is most definitely an artist to watch out for in the years to come as he is believed to have ‚Äòjust what the world needs to listen to‚Äô and it is evident in his sound and the global reach of his music.

LYRICS:
Bilmem insan
Bunu nasƒ±l edebilir ifade
(I don‚Äôt know, how can someone express this)
Aklƒ±m her an
Bile bile girebilir her hale
(My mind just can enter any kind of mood)
Biz ikimizi saklasak
(What if we hide two of us)
Biraz beklesek
(and we wait for a while)
Ya da uzatmasak
(Or let‚Äôs not put the love off)
Bunu diretmesek
(not insist on it - being seperate-)
Ve kalp akla taktƒ± bi kelep√ße hep
(And heart has always put a handcuff to the mind)

If you wanna be friends I like that
If you don‚Äôt wanna pretend, I like that more
We could be on the run, forever
You‚Äôll be my only one, forever more
My one love, my one love
Swear that I would put no one above ya
If you wanna begin, I like that
My one love, my one love

Sun le
(Listen)
Abhi tau shuru hoye ye rastay
(Our paths have just begun)
Hongai in kahaniyon ke charchay
(This story will be talked about everywhere)
O sun le, o sun le
(Just listen, Just listen)
Sun le, saari baatein karle tu khul k
(Listen, just say it out loud)
Kabhi dil ki khabar bhi tou le
(Just once look into your heart)
Kya kahe, yeh kya kahe
(What does it say, what does it say?)
Silsilay phir kyun na milay
(Why wouldn‚Äôt our streamlet meet)
Jab dil ki sabhi
(When everything that‚Äôs in our heart)
Sar-e-aam bhi dikhay
(Is out in the open)

If you wanna be friends I like that
If you don‚Äôt wanna pretend, I like that more
We could be on the run, forever
You‚Äôll be my only one, forever more
My one love, my one love
Swear that I would put no one above ya
If you wanna begin, I like that
My one love, my one love

LYRICS:
Ever since I was young (Coming up, coming up) 
Always marching to a drum (Bra-da-dum, Bra-da-dum) 
Always focused on me (One one, one one) 
Now I wish that I could hold someone (Someone) 
 
So tell my mom, I love her 
Call my baby sister 
Should've hugged and kissed her 
'Cause life is just a mystery 
And it's gone before you know it 
So if you love me, won't you show it? 
  
'Cause this life is one big symphony 
This night is one for you and me 
I'm the strings and you're the timpani 
You're my constant tambourine 
This life is one big symphony 
So glad I've got you next to m–µ 
I'm the chords and you're the m–µlody 
This life's one big symphony 
  
She was the piano 
I'm the xylophone 
You can have the trumpet 
I'm the saxophone 
 
Life is skipping rope (Keep going, keep going) 
Finding solace in a note (Dote dote, dote dote) 
Had to struggle when I was broke (So low, so low) 
Writing music just to cope (No hope, no hope) 
  
Yeah, life is just perspective 
Laughing when you've wrecked it 
Smiling when you kept it together 
You weathered the storm 
At the end of the play, you sang all the way 
Doesn't matter how off-key if you did it your way 
  
This life is one big symphony 
This night is one for you and me 
I'm the strings and you're the timpani 
You're my constant tambourine 
This life is one big symphony 
So glad I've got you next to me 
I'm the chords and you're the melody 
This life's one big symphony 
 
Would you care if I played you the flute? 
See, it's my favorite one because it's so delicate and beautiful 
I pull out the trombone if it's more suitable 
Wanna make you smile 
It's been a little while since I've seen the white of your teeth 
Been a hard year 
Lucky the guitar's here 

 Life is just one big symphony 
This life is one big symphony 
This night is one for you and me 
I'm the strings and you're the timpani 
You're my constant tambourine 
This life is one big symphony 
So glad I've got you next to me 
I'm the chords and you're the melody 
This life's one big symphony

NewJeans are the first group to launch from ADOR, HYBE‚Äôs independent label led by Min Hee-Jin. Through their truthful and authentic music that evidence youthful spirits, the five-member act (MINJI HANNI, DANIELLE, HAERIN and HYEIN) aspires to elevate K-pop to new heights by pushing the boundaries of the existing K-pop scene.

Born and raised in East Atlanta, Grammy nominated J.I.D grew up on his parents‚Äô collection of classic funk/soul LPs, and broke onto the scene with his 2015 EP, DiCaprio. The EP saw him collaborating with hip-hop duo EARTHGANG, whom he‚Äôd previously joined on a 2014 tour. Spotted here by J.Cole, J.I.D was promptly signed to Dreamville/Interscope Records. J.I.D‚Äôs nimble, head-nodding lyricism and lightning fast flow has awarded him a loyal and cult-like fanbase and his dedication to perfecting the art is sportsman-like, leaving room for him to be one of rap‚Äôs greatest in the making.

Jon Batiste is one of history‚Äôs most brilliant, prolific, and accomplished musicians. Batiste studied and received both a B.A. and M.F.A. at the world-renowned Juilliard School in New York City. In 2020, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Score for the Disney/Pixar film SOUL, an honor he shared with fellow composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. He is the second black composer in history, after legendary jazz musician Herbie Hancock, to win an Academy Award for composition. Batiste‚Äôs latest studio album, WE ARE, was released in March 2021 to overwhelming critical acclaim. Subsequently, he was nominated for eleven Grammys across seven different categories, a first in Grammy history. He went on to win five of those Grammys, including Album of the Year.

Lonely one

Don‚Äôt want to share a mumbling word
But just follow me and we will learn
It's tough but you can only be who you are
That‚Äôs just who I am that‚Äôs just my radio

It's no wait in line, stay, place your wager 
bet on little buddy, betting safer 
melancholy, cool, calm behavior, 
Before the thunder, rain, storm, the pavement 
I grew some wings that we can fly away with 
Do the things that you cannot explain and 
Find a way to get us out a maze 
What we made of, on the cusp of doing something greater, unafraid 
Been over all the underestimation, don‚Äôt get mad at your imagination
