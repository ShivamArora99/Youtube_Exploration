# YouTube Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a beginner-friendly approach to data engineering using the YouTube Data API, Python, and SQL. The aim is to extract data from YouTube, load it into a SQL database, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and conduct hypothesis testing. 

## Project Overview

### Objective
To build a comprehensive data engineering workflow that includes:
- Extracting data from the YouTube API
- Storing the data in a SQL database
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducting hypothesis testing to derive actionable insights

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting and data manipulation
- **YouTube Data API v3**: To fetch data related to YouTube videos and channels
- **SQLite**: For storing and querying the data
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database interactions
- **SciPy**: For hypothesis testing

## Steps Involved

### 1. Set Up YouTube API
- Create a Google Cloud Project and enable the YouTube Data API v3.
- Generate an API key for accessing the YouTube API.

### 2. Extract Data using YouTube API
- Use Python scripts to fetch video data from a specified YouTube channel.
- Process and save the data in a CSV file.

### 3. Load Data into SQL Database
- Use SQLAlchemy to create a connection to an SQLite database.
- Load the processed data into the database.

### 4. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Load data from the database into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Analyze and visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights.

### 5. Hypothesis Testing
- Formulate business questions and corresponding hypotheses.
- Conduct hypothesis testing to validate or refute the hypotheses.

## Business Questions and Hypotheses

1. **Does video length impact the number of views?**
   - **Hypothesis**: Longer videos get more views on average than shorter videos.
   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no difference in the number of views between longer and shorter videos.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Longer videos have a higher number of views than shorter videos.

2. **Does the publishing day of the week affect the number of views?**
   - **Hypothesis**: Videos published on weekends get more views than those published on weekdays.
   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no difference in the number of views based on the day of the week.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Videos published on weekends have more views than those published on weekdays.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Google Cloud Account
- Basic understanding of APIs, SQL, and data analysis

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-data-engineering.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Set up your Google Cloud Project and get your YouTube API key.
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_CHANNEL_ID` in the scripts with your actual API key and YouTube channel ID.
3. Run the data extraction script to fetch data from YouTube.
   ```sh
   python extract_data.py
   ```
4. Load the data into the SQL database.
   ```sh
   python load_data.py
   ```
5. Perform EDA and hypothesis testing using Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.

## Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on introduction to data engineering using real-world data from YouTube. It covers the complete data pipeline from data extraction to analysis and hypothesis testing, making it a valuable learning resource for beginners.
